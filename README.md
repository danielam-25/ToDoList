My ToDo list app is designed to allow users to easily put tasks they want to accomplish whether it be in a day, in a month, a year, etc. You can add a new habit, look at your progress for other todo lists that were on the application
I used the ai grok to help me make this app, I gave it the following description to make this app:
Create a ToDo list for easy personal use 
Should have a home page where users can input their to do lists for the day 
List should be displayed on home page with bullet points
Can be multiple tabs of todo lists that can be seen at once 
Should all be on one page 
Include bootstrap CDN and the bootstrapwatch.com brite theme. Include navigation 
All data should be stored in JSON format 
Login is not required
